# ---- DLC installation ---------------------------------------------------------
# GIANTS DLC installers are GUI-only — they ignore /SILENT and require an online
# product-key activation, so there is no way to unpack them headlessly (the
# payload inside the NSIS installer is only a <dlcStub> XML; the real .dlc is
# produced by the activation). We therefore drive the dialogs with xdotool.
#
# The flow, verified against the real installer on FS25 1.20 in a 1280x720 Xvfb:
#
#   1. Window "FarmingSimulator2025": "Please enter your <product> Product Key"
#      -> type the serial into the auto-focused field, click "Activate >"
#   2. The product window opens and installs
#   3. A small "Installation successful." message box appears -> OK, then the
#      installer exits by itself
#
# Step 3 is the awkward one: that box carries no window title of its own and
# shows up at an unpredictable moment, so there is nothing reliable to wait for.
# We therefore just click the OK position periodically — a click there while the
# wizard is still working does nothing — and treat the installer exiting as the
# clean finish.
#
# As a bounded fallback we stop once the new .dlc has not changed size for
# DLC_STABLE_WAIT seconds. Killing the installer at that point is safe and not a
# guess: the resulting file was verified byte-identical (SHA256) to one produced
# by a fully hand-clicked run. The new .dlc is identified by diffing the pdlc
# directory rather than guessing its name from the installer's filename.
