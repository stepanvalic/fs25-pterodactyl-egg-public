# Main lifecycle for the headless FS25 dedicated server.
#
#   1. Bring up a virtual X display (Wine needs one even headless).
#   2. Initialise the Wine prefix on first run.
#   3. If the game is not installed yet, run the silent installer + DLCs and the
#      one-time CD-key activation (see lib/install-game.sh).
#   4. Render the two config XMLs from the environment variables.
#   5. Launch dedicatedServer.exe (the web control portal on $WEB_PORT).
#   6. Ask the web portal to start the actual game session.
#   7. Tail the server log to stdout so it shows up in the panel console.
#   8. On SIGINT/SIGTERM, shut the server down cleanly.
